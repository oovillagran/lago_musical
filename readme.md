<!-- PROJECT DESCRIPTION -->

# 📖 Lago Musical <a name="about-project"></a>

**Lago Musical** is a technical test that allows you to input a given sound from the list of sounds each animal makes and returns the remaining sounds from any of the three songs the explorer wrote.

One day, an explorer began following some strange sounds, eventually reaching a lake where he found the source: three little animals making sounds similar to a song. After a short while, the explorer was able to distinguish which animal produced each sound.

Sounds
Frog: brr, birip, brrah, croac
Dragonfly: fiu, plop, pep
Cricket: cric-cric, trri-trri, bri-bri

After some time, he discovered they were 'singing' together. Whenever the frog started with brr, the dragonfly responded by rubbing its tail against a branch, producing a sound like fiu. After the dragonfly, the cricket continued with cric-cric, but whenever the frog sounded like brrah or croac, all the animals fell silent for a while and then resumed. Before the sky darkened, the explorer managed to write down three 'songs' they all sang together, and these notes came to his mind.

Songs
brr, fiu, cric-cric, brrah
pep, birip, trri-trri, croac
bri-bri, plop, cric-cric, brrah

EXERCISE
Using the programming language you feel most comfortable with, write a program that allows you to input a given sound from the list of sounds each animal makes and returns the remaining sounds from any of the three songs the explorer wrote. For example:

When given brr, it should play fiu, cric-cric, brrah according to the first song.
When given birip, it should play trri-trri, croac according to the second song.
When given plop, it should play cric-cric, brrah according to the third song.
When given croac or brrah, it shouldn't play anything according to all the songs."
